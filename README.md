# LightFrame
A very basic PHP framework that is made to suit my needs.

---

I like to keep things simple. So I don't really use any framework at all if I'm not forced to do so. This is why I created a pile of code that I like to include in all of my PHP based projects.
It doesn't limit you at all, it doesn't forces a specific way of thinking all learning at all, it just saves you some minutes of coding at the creation of a new project.

### It includes
- A router
- Some utility functions
- A configuration system
- A regionalization system
- A basic directory structure
- Config for [LoginMaster][https://github.com/gergof/LoginMaster] (you only need to uncomment some lines in _config.php_ and _index.php_ to enable it)

### Usage
__Note: I don't recommend using this framework at all.__
But if you want to do so anyway, you just have to clone this repo and copy the contents of the _src_ directory to the root of your project tree. You have to figure out the rest for yourself, since I was lazy to write a documentation.
